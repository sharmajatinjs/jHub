            <p>Sung Jin-Woo (성진우) is the protagonist of Solo Leveling. He was previously known as the "Weakest Hunter of All Mankind" due to his low rank and feeble strength. However, after the path of becoming the World's Strongest Hunter, he was Reawakened and became a Player after surviving the Cartenon Temple and completing the secret quest "Courage of the Weak." The mysterious System has allowed Jin-Woo to "level up" and increases his abilities and strength until he is reawakened.</p>
